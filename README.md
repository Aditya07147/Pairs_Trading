# Pairs_Trading
This project applies a statistical arbitrage strategy for pairs trading by identifying cointegrated stock pairs through a multi-stage pipeline using PCA, OPTICS clustering, cointegration tests, Hurst exponent, and spread half-life to ensure robustness. Top pairs are selected for potential backtesting.
